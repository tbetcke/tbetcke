### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational scientist on the interface of Mathematics, engineering, physical sciences and computer science. Basically, I love everything that combines great maths, lots of computing and cool applications. My particular focus area is boundary integral equations, where for a long time I have worked on the Bempp software package. Below you find some links to papers, and other official information.
